# Love Running

Anabel's Sweets is a site I made to help my sister in the cake making business. I figured since she makes her cakes at home and doesnt really have the capital to pay someone to make her a website I culd use this opportunity to make it myself. In this page, people that see the website will be able to see a little about what she is all about, get a glimpse of her goals and her past projects. They will also be able to send a quote request to see if they want a cake or not.

## Testing 

I have tested all the buttons and made sure everything is in its place so that everything is working as intended. 

I have also added specific code to target the website in different screen sizes.



### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

### Unfixed Bugs

Some formats cause the page to use more space than neccessary, causing the lighthouse to show lower scores.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
